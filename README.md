## BlackJack

A slightly modified version of Blackjack

### Description 

A Blackjack game for one player versus the computer. The player has the starting chips of $1000. Each hand is dealt two cards, and one of the computer's card is revealed to the player. The player can then choose to draw a card (hit), or stop drawing when they are satisfied (stay) or when they bust (points exceed 21 - at which point the computer wins). If the player doesn't bust, the computer draws until it either has more points than the player (computer wins), or busts (player wins). The player can play until they lose all chips, or until they want to quit.
